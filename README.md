# hangman

Hello! So this is my first independent project and I decided to upload it to GitHub, so please don't mind if my code is a bit extra haha. I'm open to any feedback you may have for me, so please feel free to be constructively critical :)

This is a 2 Player game of Hangman, and the instructions are there within the file itself when you run it. I'd recommend running it on the command line for the best results.

Enjoy!
